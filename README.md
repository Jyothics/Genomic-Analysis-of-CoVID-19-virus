Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause illnesses ranging widely in severity. The first known severe illness caused by a coronavirus appeared with the  2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in China. A second outbreak of severe illness originated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). And now the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19. we will interpret, analyze the COVID-19 DNA sequence data and try to get as many insights regarding the proteins that made it up. Later will compare COVID-19 DNA with MERS and SARS and weâ€™ll understand the relationship among them.
